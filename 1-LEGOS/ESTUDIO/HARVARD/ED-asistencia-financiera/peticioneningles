My name is El√≠as Hung, I worked as a computer teacher for children in Venezuela for 20 years, but I only received $100 as pension and $5 per month as retirement. The Venezuelan government persecutes people like me who think differently and does not recognize the effort and professional value we have. I also got heart disease and metabolic disease because I starved and gave lessons, that is, at work, without being recognized; I live with my brother because I never had the opportunity to buy my own house with such a small salary. I work in waste recycling, turning waste into functional equipment. So I want you to help me learn well the art of programming and artificial intelligence so that I can help the young people of my community and my church to program through the Internet and thus avoid migrations and painful separations from families in Venezuela, although we have little, we really want to learn and help, I want to pay for my studies by working with you if possible, but please, I ask you for an opportunity to invest in knowledge and get out of poverty.
 I know I have good ideas, people from my community follow me, I speak Spanish reasonably clearly (I have to translate this letter with Google translator...), I learned a little of everything myself... (algorithms, logic, bash, git, HTML, python, web server, server administration) I am working on a complete operating system that teaches new technologies easily, but only with the few tools I have; it is very hard. Please help me put together machinery that will defeat ignorance and allow me to reach ever higher goals of love and service. If I need to work with you to finance my studies, I am willing to do so.
